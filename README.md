conway_life_python
==================

Simple implementation of Conway's game of life in python.

Prerequisites: python 2.7.x, pygame.

It may be necessary to change the first line in conway.py based on your system.  My linux distribution has a separate executable for python2, hence the unusual #!/usr/bin/python2
